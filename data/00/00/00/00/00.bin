we now have first-person intel
from inside the Westview Anomaly.

195
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:33,866
Our initial theory had
Wanda Maximoff as one of many victims.

196
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:36,827
We now know
she is the principal victimizer.

WOO: Quick history on our subject.

199
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:45,919
Born in Sokovia in 1989
to Irina and Olek Maximoff,

200
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:47,629
both killed during an air raid

201
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:50,465
when Maximoff
and her twin brother, Pietro, were ten.

202
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:54,136
HAYWARD: The twins were subsequently
radicalized, volunteering at HYDRA.

203
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:57,556
It's an oversimplification
of events, but, yes.

204
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:01,101
After unspecified experimentation
with the Mind Stone,

205
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:05,147
Maximoff gained
telekinetic and telepathic abilities.

206
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,358
Back up, Jimmy.
Does Maximoff have an alias?

207
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,361
-No, sir.
-No funny nickname?

208
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:12,696
Not a one.

209
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,824
And earliest tracking had her using
her powers against the Avengers.

210
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:16,909
Is that correct?

211
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:20,162
Right before she earned their trust
and became one herself.

212
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:24,708
HAYWARD: Lagos and Germany,
we all know how that turned out.

213
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:26,627
Thanks, Jimmy.

214
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:32,216
Now that we have the lay of the land,
let's talk about strategy.

215
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,300

Wanda's not a terrorist.

220
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:42,226
HAYWARD: By your own account,
you described the experience

221
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:45,354
of being under her mind-control as

222
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:48,565
"excruciating, terrifying, a violation."

she has a political agenda

this is a premeditated act of aggression.

disregarded his wishes.
